Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to share something I've been working on.

After 20+ years in enterprise software, I built an AI-powered news platform called Dashboard1. It curates positive, constructive news to fight information overload and doom-scrolling.

The platform uses sentiment analysis to filter signal from noise across 15+ news sources.

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Remember how we used to talk about the future of technology? Well, I finally took the plunge into AI development.

It's been quite a journey from our PeopleSoft days! The platform uses sentiment analysis and quality scoring to filter signal from noise across 15+ news sources.

If you think your network might find it useful, I'd be grateful if you could share it. I can provide ready-made social media posts to make it super easy.

**From PeopleSoft to AI: Building Dashboard1 - My Journey into Modern Web Development**

After 20+ years in enterprise software, I took on a personal challenge: build an AI-powered news platform that fights information overload.

The result? Dashboard1 - a full-stack application that curates constructive journalism using sentiment analysis and quality scoring.

🤖 **What Dashboard1 does:**
✅ Processes 15+ news sources in real-time
✅ Uses AI sentiment analysis to filter positive, solution-focused content
✅ Eliminates clickbait and doom-scrolling triggers
✅ Provides personalized news curation without the anxiety

🛠️ **Technical implementation:**
• Node.js backend with MongoDB
• Real-time RSS processing and AI integration
• JWT authentication system
• PWA with offline capabilities
• Responsive design with vanilla JavaScript

**Why I built this:** As professionals, we need to stay informed, but traditional news consumption often leads to information overwhelm and anxiety. Dashboard1 promotes "signal over noise" - helping users stay updated on what matters without the mental health cost.

**The learning journey:** Transitioning from PeopleSoft FSCM to modern web development has been incredibly rewarding. The problem-solving skills from enterprise software translate beautifully to AI applications and user experience design.

For fellow professionals struggling with news anxiety while needing to stay informed - this might be exactly what you need.

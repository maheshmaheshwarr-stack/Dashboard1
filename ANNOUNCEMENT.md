**Title:** Built an AI-powered news aggregator that filters panic and highlights positivity

```
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a news dashboard that takes a different approach to news consumption. Instead of optimizing for engagement through urgency, it prioritizes constructive, positive content with lasting impact.

**What it does:**
- Aggregates from 25+ sources (The Hindu, BBC, TechCrunch, Reuters, etc.)
- AI scores articles for positivity and filters sensational headlines
- Shows "What AI Ignored" - the panic-driven stories it deprioritized
- Community discussions powered by GitHub Discussions
- Fresh warm & friendly design

**Tech Stack:**
- Pure vanilla JS (no frameworks!)
- RSS2JSON for feed aggregation
- Giscus for comments
- GitHub Pages hosting

**Live Demo:** https://maheshmaheshwarr-stack.github.io/Dashboard1/

**Philosophy:**
Signal over noise. Positivity over panic. Context over breaking news.

Would love your feedback! Open to contributions and suggestions.

## Hacker News Post

**Title:** Show HN: AI-curated news dashboard that resists panic and highlights signal

```
Hi HN,

I built a news aggregator that intentionally deprioritizes "breaking news" panic in favor of constructive, durable content.

Key features:
- AI positivity scoring (filters sensational headlines)
- 25+ RSS sources (Indian & international news, tech, business)
- Shows "What AI Ignored" section for transparency
- Community discussions via GitHub Discussions
- Zero tracking, privacy-friendly

Tech: Vanilla JS, RSS2JSON API, Giscus, GitHub Pages

The goal is to create a "calm information diet" - focusing on what matters rather than what's urgent.
